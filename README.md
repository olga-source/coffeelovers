## 📡 Project Overview

This project is a simple and interactive web application that integrates with the public API **[SampleAPIs Coffee API](https://sampleapis.com/api-list/coffee)** — an API designed for coffee lovers. I chose this API because of my personal love for coffee, and it offered a fun dataset to work with.

The site features a clean layout with a header, descriptive text, and two buttons. Users can toggle between the buttons to fetch and display different data from the API dynamically, creating an engaging and responsive user experience.

🌐 How It Works

The site displays a header and a image of a cup of coffee at the top.
Two buttons 'Hot coffee' and 'Iced coffee' allow users to select between two categories which display as a table which contains Title, Description, Ingridients and Image.
Clicking a button triggers an API request and updates the content on the page with the fetched data.
